# Programming Concepts Refined

## Description
This repository serves as a collection of articles and explanations on various programming concepts, design principles, and best practices. It aims to provide clear, concise, and practical insights into complex topics in software development.

## Purpose
The goal of this repository is to:
1. Offer detailed explanations of important programming concepts
2. Provide practical examples and use cases
3. Serve as a quick reference for developers of all levels
4. Encourage best practices in software design and development

## Contents
Currently, this repository covers the following topics:

1. SOLID Principles
   - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
   - Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
   - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
   - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
   - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

(More topics will be added over time)

## Structure
Each topic is contained in its own directory or in form of single file if possible, which includes:
- A main markdown file with the detailed explanation
- Code examples (if applicable)
- Additional resources or related topics

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to add a new topic, improve an existing explanation, or fix any errors, please feel free to submit a pull request.

## A Final Thought

As we delve into these fundamental concepts, it's worth remembering a humorous anecdote shared by Barbara Liskov in her ACM Turing Award lecture:

> "When I received the Turing Award, there was a joke circulating on the internet: 'Why is she getting an award for something everybody knows?'"

This quip reminds us that while these principles might seem obvious in retrospect, their formulation and widespread adoption have profoundly shaped the field of software development. It's our hope that this repository helps illuminate these "obvious" yet crucial concepts for developers at all stages of their journey.

Happy learning and coding!
