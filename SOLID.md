## 2. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

- A class should have only one reason to change.
- Each class or module should focus on a single task or functionality.
- Benefits: Improved maintainability, easier testing, and reduced coupling.

### Example:

```python
# Violating SRP
class Employee:
    def __init__(self, name, id):
        self.name = name
        self.id = id

    def save_employee_to_database(self):
        # Code to save employee to database
        print(f"Saving employee {self.name} to database")

    def generate_employee_report(self):
        # Code to generate employee report
        print(f"Generating report for employee {self.name}")

# Applying SRP
class Employee:
    def __init__(self, name, id):
        self.name = name
        self.id = id

class EmployeeDatabase:
    @staticmethod
    def save(employee):
        # Code to save employee to database
        print(f"Saving employee {employee.name} to database")

class EmployeeReportGenerator:
    @staticmethod
    def generate_report(employee):
        # Code to generate employee report
        print(f"Generating report for employee {employee.name}")

# Usage
employee = Employee("John Doe", 12345)
EmployeeDatabase.save(employee)
EmployeeReportGenerator.generate_report(employee)
```

This example demonstrates the Single Responsibility Principle:

1. In the first part, we have an `Employee` class that violates SRP. It's responsible for both saving the employee to a database and generating reports. This class has multiple reasons to change.
2. In the second part, we refactor the code to adhere to SRP:
    - The `Employee` class now only holds employee data.
    - `EmployeeDatabase` is responsible for database operations.
    - `EmployeeReportGenerator` handles report generation.

By separating these responsibilities, we've made the code more modular and easier to maintain. Each class now has a single reason to change, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle.

## 3. Open-Closed Principle (OCP)

- Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- You should be able to extend a class's behavior without modifying its existing code.
- Often achieved through the use of interfaces and abstract classes.

### Example:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# Violating OCP
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, width, height):
        self.width = width
        self.height = height

class AreaCalculator:
    def calculate_area(self, rectangle):
        return rectangle.width * rectangle.height

# If we want to add a new shape (e.g., Circle), we'd need to modify AreaCalculator

# Applying OCP
class Shape(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def calculate_area(self):
        pass

class Rectangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, width, height):
        self.width = width
        self.height = height
    
    def calculate_area(self):
        return self.width * self.height

class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius
    
    def calculate_area(self):
        return 3.14 * self.radius * self.radius

class AreaCalculator:
    def calculate_area(self, shape):
        return shape.calculate_area()

# Usage
rectangle = Rectangle(5, 4)
circle = Circle(3)

calculator = AreaCalculator()
print(f"Rectangle area: {calculator.calculate_area(rectangle)}")
print(f"Circle area: {calculator.calculate_area(circle)}")
```

This example demonstrates the Open-Closed Principle:

1. In the first part, we have a `Rectangle` class and an `AreaCalculator` that violates OCP. If we wanted to add a new shape, we'd need to modify the `AreaCalculator` class.
2. In the second part, we refactor the code to adhere to OCP:
    - We introduce an abstract `Shape` class with an abstract `calculate_area` method.
    - `Rectangle` and `Circle` classes inherit from `Shape` and implement their own `calculate_area` methods.
    - The `AreaCalculator` now works with any `Shape` object, without needing to know the specific type.

By using this design:

- We can add new shapes (like Triangle, Square, etc.) without modifying existing code.
- The `AreaCalculator` is now closed for modification but open for extension through new `Shape` subclasses.

This approach makes the code more flexible and easier to extend without risking bugs in existing functionality.

## 4. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

- Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program.
- Subclasses should extend the base classes without changing their behavior.
- Ensures that inheritance is used correctly.

### Example:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# Violating LSP
class Bird:
    def fly(self):
        print("I can fly")

class Ostrich(Bird):
    def fly(self):
        raise Exception("I can't fly")  # This violates LSP

# Applying LSP
class Bird(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def move(self):
        pass

class FlyingBird(Bird):
    def move(self):
        print("I'm flying")

class NonFlyingBird(Bird):
    def move(self):
        print("I'm walking")

class Sparrow(FlyingBird):
    pass

class Ostrich(NonFlyingBird):
    pass

# Function that uses Bird objects
def make_bird_move(bird: Bird):
    bird.move()

# Usage
sparrow = Sparrow()
ostrich = Ostrich()

make_bird_move(sparrow)  # Output: I'm flying
make_bird_move(ostrich)  # Output: I'm walking
```

This example demonstrates the Liskov Substitution Principle:

1. In the first part, we have a `Bird` class with a `fly` method. The `Ostrich` subclass violates LSP because it can't fulfill the contract of its base class (it can't fly).
2. In the second part, we refactor the code to adhere to LSP:
    - We introduce an abstract `Bird` class with an abstract `move` method.
    - We create `FlyingBird` and `NonFlyingBird` subclasses that implement `move` differently.
    - `Sparrow` and `Ostrich` inherit from the appropriate subclasses.

Key points:

- The `make_bird_move` function can work with any `Bird` object, including all subclasses.
- We can substitute a `Sparrow` or an `Ostrich` for a `Bird` without breaking the program's functionality.
- This design respects the behavior of different types of birds while maintaining a common interface.

By adhering to LSP:

- We ensure that subclasses can be used interchangeably with their base classes.
- The code becomes more flexible and extensible.
- We avoid unexpected errors when using derived classes in place of base classes.<a name="isp"></a>
## 5. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

- Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.
- No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.
- Aims to split large interfaces into smaller and more specific ones.

### Example:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# Violating ISP
class Worker(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def work(self):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def eat(self):
        pass

class Human(Worker):
    def work(self):
        print("Human working")

    def eat(self):
        print("Human eating")

class Robot(Worker):
    def work(self):
        print("Robot working")

    def eat(self):
        raise NotImplementedError("Robots don't eat")

# Applying ISP
class Workable(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def work(self):
        pass

class Eatable(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def eat(self):
        pass

class Human(Workable, Eatable):
    def work(self):
        print("Human working")

    def eat(self):
        print("Human eating")

class Robot(Workable):
    def work(self):
        print("Robot working")

# Usage
def make_work(worker: Workable):
    worker.work()

def make_eat(eater: Eatable):
    eater.eat()

human = Human()
robot = Robot()

make_work(human)  # Output: Human working
make_work(robot)  # Output: Robot working
make_eat(human)   # Output: Human eating
# make_eat(robot) # This would raise an error, as Robot doesn't implement Eatable
```

This example demonstrates the Interface Segregation Principle:

1. In the first part, we have a `Worker` interface that violates ISP. It forces the `Robot` class to implement an `eat` method it doesn't need.
2. In the second part, we refactor the code to adhere to ISP:
    - We split the `Worker` interface into two separate interfaces: `Workable` and `Eatable`.
    - `Human` implements both interfaces because humans can work and eat.
    - `Robot` only implements the `Workable` interface, as robots don't eat.

Key points:

- By segregating the interfaces, we avoid forcing classes to implement methods they don't need.
- The `Robot` class no longer needs to provide an unnecessary `eat` method.
- We can now have separate functions that work with `Workable` and `Eatable` objects, increasing flexibility.

Benefits of adhering to ISP:

- It leads to more focused and cohesive interfaces.
- It reduces the impact of changes, as classes only depend on the methods they actually use.
- It makes the system more flexible and easier to refactor.

## 6. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
- Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
- Often implemented using dependency injection.

### Example:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# Violating DIP
class EmailSender:
    def send_email(self, message):
        print(f"Sending email: {message}")

class NotificationService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.email_sender = EmailSender()

    def send_notification(self, message):
        self.email_sender.send_email(message)

# Applying DIP
class MessageSender(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def send_message(self, message):
        pass

class EmailSender(MessageSender):
    def send_message(self, message):
        print(f"Sending email: {message}")

class SMSSender(MessageSender):
    def send_message(self, message):
        print(f"Sending SMS: {message}")

class NotificationService:
    def __init__(self, message_sender: MessageSender):
        self.message_sender = message_sender

    def send_notification(self, message):
        self.message_sender.send_message(message)

# Usage
email_sender = EmailSender()
sms_sender = SMSSender()

email_notification_service = NotificationService(email_sender)
sms_notification_service = NotificationService(sms_sender)

email_notification_service.send_notification("Hello via email")
sms_notification_service.send_notification("Hello via SMS")
```

This example demonstrates the Dependency Inversion Principle:

1. In the first part, we have a `NotificationService` that directly depends on the `EmailSender` class. This violates DIP because the high-level `NotificationService` depends on the low-level `EmailSender`.
2. In the second part, we refactor the code to adhere to DIP:
    - We introduce an abstract `MessageSender` class that defines the interface for sending messages.
    - `EmailSender` and `SMSSender` implement this interface.
    - `NotificationService` now depends on the `MessageSender` abstraction, not on concrete implementations.

Key points:

- The high-level `NotificationService` now depends on the abstraction (`MessageSender`), not on concrete classes.
- We can easily add new types of message senders (e.g., `PushNotificationSender`) without modifying `NotificationService`.
- The `NotificationService` is now more flexible and can work with any type of `MessageSender`.

Benefits of adhering to DIP:

- It increases flexibility by allowing easy substitution of different implementations.
- It improves modularity and reduces coupling between components.
- It facilitates easier testing by allowing mock objects to be injected.

This principle is often implemented using dependency injection, as shown in the example where the `MessageSender` is injected into the `NotificationService`.

## 7. How SOLID Principles Work Together

The SOLID principles work together to create more maintainable, flexible, and robust software designs. Here's an overview of how they complement each other:

1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and Open-Closed Principle (OCP):
    - SRP encourages breaking down complex classes into smaller, focused ones.
    - This modular design makes it easier to extend functionality without modifying existing code (OCP).
    - Together, they promote a design where new features can be added by creating new classes rather than changing existing ones.
2. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) and Open-Closed Principle (OCP):
    - LSP ensures that subclasses can be used interchangeably with their base classes.
    - This interchangeability supports OCP by allowing new functionality to be added through subclassing without breaking existing code.
3. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) and Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):
    - ISP promotes smaller, more focused interfaces.
    - These focused interfaces make it easier to implement DIP, as high-level modules can depend on specific abstractions rather than large, monolithic interfaces.
4. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):
    - Both principles encourage breaking down large, complex structures into smaller, more manageable pieces.
    - SRP focuses on classes and modules, while ISP focuses on interfaces.
5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) and Open-Closed Principle (OCP):
    - DIP's emphasis on depending on abstractions supports OCP by making it easier to extend systems without modifying existing code.
    - New implementations can be added by creating new classes that adhere to existing abstractions.
6. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) and Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):
    - LSP ensures that interfaces are used correctly in inheritance hierarchies.
    - ISP ensures that these interfaces are not bloated with unnecessary methods.
    - Together, they lead to well-designed, focused interfaces that can be reliably implemented and extended.

In practice, applying these principles together leads to several benefits:

1. Modularity: Systems become more modular, with clear separation of concerns.
2. Flexibility: It's easier to extend and modify the system without causing widespread changes.
3. Reusability: Components designed with these principles are often more reusable in different contexts.
4. Testability: The resulting designs are typically easier to unit test due to reduced coupling and clear interfaces.
5. Maintainability: Code becomes easier to understand and maintain over time.

It's important to note that while these principles are powerful guidelines, they should be applied judiciously. Over-application can lead to unnecessary complexity. The goal is to find the right balance for your specific project needs.

## 8. Comprehensive Example: Order Processing System

This example demonstrates how all five SOLID principles can be applied together in a single design:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from typing import List

# SRP: Each class has a single responsibility
class Order:
    def __init__(self, items: List[str], total: float):
        self.items = items
        self.total = total

# OCP & ISP: PaymentProcessor is an abstract base class,
# open for extension (new payment methods) but closed for modification
class PaymentProcessor(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def process_payment(self, amount: float) -> bool:
        pass

class CreditCardProcessor(PaymentProcessor):
    def process_payment(self, amount: float) -> bool:
        print(f"Processing credit card payment of ${amount}")
        return True

class PayPalProcessor(PaymentProcessor):
    def process_payment(self, amount: float) -> bool:
        print(f"Processing PayPal payment of ${amount}")
        return True

# ISP: Separate interfaces for different types of notifications
class EmailNotifier(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def send_email(self, message: str):
        pass

class SMSNotifier(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def send_sms(self, message: str):
        pass

# LSP: NotificationService can work with any combination of notifiers
class NotificationService:
    def __init__(self, email_notifier: EmailNotifier = None, sms_notifier: SMSNotifier = None):
        self.email_notifier = email_notifier
        self.sms_notifier = sms_notifier

    def notify(self, message: str):
        if self.email_notifier:
            self.email_notifier.send_email(message)
        if self.sms_notifier:
            self.sms_notifier.send_sms(message)

# Concrete implementations of notifiers
class EmailNotifierImpl(EmailNotifier):
    def send_email(self, message: str):
        print(f"Sending email: {message}")

class SMSNotifierImpl(SMSNotifier):
    def send_sms(self, message: str):
        print(f"Sending SMS: {message}")

# DIP: OrderProcessor depends on abstractions (PaymentProcessor, NotificationService)
class OrderProcessor:
    def __init__(self, payment_processor: PaymentProcessor, notification_service: NotificationService):
        self.payment_processor = payment_processor
        self.notification_service = notification_service

    def process_order(self, order: Order):
        if self.payment_processor.process_payment(order.total):
            self.notification_service.notify(f"Order processed successfully. Total: ${order.total}")
        else:
            self.notification_service.notify("Order processing failed.")

# Usage
order = Order(["item1", "item2"], 100.0)
credit_card_processor = CreditCardProcessor()
email_notifier = EmailNotifierImpl()
sms_notifier = SMSNotifierImpl()
notification_service = NotificationService(email_notifier, sms_notifier)

order_processor = OrderProcessor(credit_card_processor, notification_service)
order_processor.process_order(order)

# Easy to extend with new payment method without modifying existing code
paypal_processor = PayPalProcessor()
paypal_order_processor = OrderProcessor(paypal_processor, notification_service)
paypal_order_processor.process_order(order)
```

This example demonstrates how all five SOLID principles can work together in a single design:

1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
    - Each class has a single, well-defined responsibility. For example, `Order` only holds order data, `PaymentProcessor` only handles payments, and `NotificationService` only manages notifications.
2. Open-Closed Principle (OCP):
    - The system is open for extension but closed for modification. New payment methods (like `PayPalProcessor`) can be added without changing existing code.
3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):
    - Subtypes (`CreditCardProcessor`, `PayPalProcessor`) can be used interchangeably with their base type (`PaymentProcessor`) without affecting the correctness of the program.
4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):
    - Instead of having a single large `Notifier` interface, we have separate `EmailNotifier` and `SMSNotifier` interfaces. This allows clients to depend only on the methods they need.
5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):
    - High-level modules (`OrderProcessor`) depend on abstractions (`PaymentProcessor`, `NotificationService`) rather than concrete implementations.

Benefits of this design:

- Flexibility: Easy to add new payment methods or notification types.
- Testability: Each component can be easily unit tested in isolation.
- Maintainability: Changes to one part of the system (e.g., adding a new payment method) don't require changes to other parts.
- Reusability: Components like `NotificationService` can be reused in different contexts.

This example shows how the SOLID principles complement each other to create a flexible, maintainable, and extensible design. In practice, the level of abstraction and separation would depend on the specific requirements and scale of your project.
